# Queues

Stacks and queues are two examples of abstract data types. Whereas stacks are LIFO (last in, first out), queues are FIFO (first in, first out).

Whereas stacks are similar to a stack of plates, think of queues as... Well, a queue, or in American English, a line.

Queues, customarily, have the following methods:

* peek - Finds the first in line.
* enqueue - Adds an item to the end of the line.
* dequeue - Remove an item from the beginning of the line.
* size - Determines the current number of elements in a queue.
* isEmpty - Determines if the queue is empty.

There are lots of uses for stacks and queues, as all of their operations have an O(n) time complexity. For queues, think of the following applications:

* Limiting participants in an online video game to manage server load.
* Limiting active calls on a customer service line.
* Handling cards in a card game.

**Can you think of other applications?**
